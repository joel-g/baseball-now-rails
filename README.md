This app was built to meet the specifications of a coding challenge given to me by a prospective employer. The specs were:

Build a web app for a baseball scout to record data about baseball players' performance.

Level 1: Form + simple visualization with 10s of players’ data

Level 2: (stretch) Handle 100s of data points for players. Allow for bulk input of data.

Level 3: (stretch) Improve interactivity in the visualization of results

Level 4: (stretch) Store players’ data in a database
